# ComprehensibleInputDotNet
.Net 8 Program for Receiving Texts in Various Languages and Whether They Make Good Comprehensible Input


# Aims

In this project, I want to write a website which does the following:

1) Loads lots of text very very fast
2) Can judge the difficulty of the text based mainly on vocabulary, but also on the basis of sentence length
3) Can determine the easiest path through a set of books given their difficulty in a selected corpus, acknowledging the user's previous read content
4) Can determine the most profitable books for a user to read, either with or without previously read content
5) Can save and make searchable results for all content publicly uploaded
6) Can suggest content which has similar vocabulary to what a user already has read

# ComprehensibleInputDotNet
.Net 8 Program for Receiving Texts in Various Languages and Whether They Make Good Comprehensible Input


# Aims

In this project, I want to write a website which does the following:

1) Loads lots of text very very fast
2) Can judge the difficulty of the text based mainly on vocabulary, but also on the basis of sentence length
3) Can determine the shortest path to cover all the vocabulary in a given corpus
4) Can determine the least difficult order with which to cover a given corpus
5) Can store and make publically available difficulty statistics for different texts
